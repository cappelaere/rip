Atom Feeds may be extended
==========================

**As** a web service  
**I want to** extend ATOM protocol  
**So that I** can publish my custom resources in a meaningful way for external applications
		
> **rationale** This allows an external application to mine the entries of a feed without having to parse the HTML content of the entry.  ATOM Extensions can be done using the GData 2.0 or 1.0 protocol, or OData 1.0.
